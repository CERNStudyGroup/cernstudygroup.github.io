## How do I get started?

We put together a set of documents and actions you might want to look at. 

### Code of Conduct
The CERN Study Group adheres to the Mozilla Science Lab's Code of Conduct. You can find the CERN Study Group Code of Contact [here](https://github.com/CERNStudyGroup/cernstudygroup.github.io/blob/master/codeOfConduct.md) By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. 

### Get to know the others and introduce yourself!
Have a look at the other [study group members](https://github.com/CERNStudyGroup/cernstudygroup.github.io/issues/26) and [their projects](https://github.com/CERNStudyGroup/cernstudygroup.github.io/issues/24). These threads can help you to find people and projects to collaborate. Please also introduce yourself and your project - if you have one - there.

###Add yourself to the website 
If you'd like to appear on the website under the 'Who we Are' section, have a look at the '_data/members.yml'; send us a pull request with an entry for yourself, or open an issue and we'll do it for you.

## The next step

### Meet us in person
We meet every Friday at CERN. You can find upcoming events in the 'Events' section of the [CERN Study Group website](http://cernstudygroup.github.io/).

### Help out with the organisation
To make this Study Group as awesome as possible, everyone should get involved. So if you're a master baker and want to bring cakes, are an Indico wizard and can book rooms for sessions or can help out with anything else: please volunteer yourself on [gitter](https://gitter.im/CERNStudyGroup/cernstudygroup.github.io)!

## Become a leader

### Suggest or lead a session
If you're interested in a topic or currently working on something great that you would like to share with a wider audience, please create an issue, label it "lesson" and get the discussion started and your lesson scheduled.
